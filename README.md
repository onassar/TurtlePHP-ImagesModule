TurtlePHP-ImagesModule
======================

Note to myself: I decoupled this from TurtlePHP-FilesModule to allow me to make
use of the image-manipulation routing regardless of whether it's through an
admin interface for file uploading, or user-based file uploading.

More flexible this way, for down the line :)
